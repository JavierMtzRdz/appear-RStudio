# appear-RStudio

This repository contains my personal customizations of RStudio in Mac, including a [dark icon by Amir Masoud](https://github.com/amirmasoudabdol/rstudio-icons?tab=readme-ov-file), a theme based on [{rsthemes}](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes) and [CodeFira](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. The final look should be similar to this.
